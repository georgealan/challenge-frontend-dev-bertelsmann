<h1 align="center">Project: Medical Appointment Form</h1>

### Why create a form project?
I chose to use forms to practice because it is very common to use forms in large systems, and it is a topic that I like to train to improve and create better forms. It is also a very interesting topic to practice styling with CSS, it is quite challenging to think of a design for all forms and style each input, labels, etc. with CSS.

### How I composed the project
To compose the project, I searched for images related to hospitals and doctors on the Freepik website, obtained some, and treated them in Photoshop, removing the background from the image of the doctor and the logo. To create the layout, I quickly made a sketch in Figma just to clarify the idea I had for something visual. From there, I built the layout in HTML and styled the template skeleton to match my sketch.

The project is not responsive, so I set a height limit for the window in pixels, only the width obeys a percentage limit between the left and right sections. In a future project, I will use flex-box, grid, and responsive. I just want to feel comfortable creating complex layouts using only position before moving on to flex-box and so on.

I used JavaScript in a few places to create some effects, such as in the menu, and to populate the options tags of the select fields of the forms, simple things to avoid polluting the HTML code with too much text.

### What I am learning
I am learning many new HTML form tags, discovering properties, and understanding how to use them in a real project, even though it is a fictional project, it is possible to emulate the use of these properties in a real domain system.

I had to search for examples of medical forms, think about how to treat critical fields that must be filled in compulsorily, it was not simply about creating random form fields without purpose, I researched to try to do something similar.
